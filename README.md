# Abstract:
Our idea is to make a full fledged human-like bot which can perform almost all functions of human. This semi-automated bot can be deployed in various domains such as in paramedics, military, healthcare, banking, industries, etc. Moroever, its main utility arises in fields which is risky for humans. For eg.- in fire fighting situations, etc.

# Pre-requisite of Software:
Complete project is arduino based. Arduino IDE is required as a software which can be downloaded from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

# Components Used:
1. dc geared motor(200 rpm) - 8
2. rotary potentiometer(10k ohm) -8
3. arduino mega - 1
4. adapter(12 V dc) - 2
5. motor driver(control speed of two dc motors) - 4

# Mechanical Design:
 After going through different types of design, we finally reached this type of stable design.
